# Local Development

## make run / make clean

- `make run` installs the required dependencies and uses **air** for automatic build of the project.
- The generated binary will be placed under the `tmp` directory.
- The default port is `3000`, but you can adjust it in the `.env` file.

## make up / make down

- `make up` starts the entire local development environment using **docker compose**.
- Everything runs fully inside Docker, ensuring a 100% clean environment.
- When you exit the container, all builds and `node_modules` will not be preserved.
- The default port is `8080`, but you can adjust it in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- It is recommended to use Docker for development to keep your local system clean.
